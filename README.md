  5. Jupyter
 
## Input Files: 
- To train, validate and test the model images provided udacity were used,all such images are stored in the folder 
"traffic-signs-data" of this project. 
- 11 images from web were downloaded and used for checking the model accuracy ,these images are stored in a folder 
  named "web_image". 
- The file "signnames.csv" contains the names for each traffic sign signal. Labels are based on the serial numbers 
  mentioned in this file.

## Output Files:
   There are no specific outputs all the outputs are shown in the Jupyter notebook file.

## Project File:
